# Cellendipity Grow

2nd August 2016

This is a project based on Cellendipity_NOC and inspired by Crotcheting

Description:

Cells are attracted to food objects

Initially, a single, stationary food object is created at a random position.
The first cell which arrives at the food is killed and replaced by a new item of food.
All food items are displayed.
Expected behaviour: Food aggregates in an unpredictable form.


My goals are:

1) to implement a food object

2) to implement a behaviour which attracts cells to the most recently added food

3) to implement a rule whereby cells die on contact with food and are replaced by a new food object
